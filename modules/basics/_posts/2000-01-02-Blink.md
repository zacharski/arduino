# LED lights

## Introduction

We are all familiar with LED lights. They are all around us from household lights, flashlights, and indicator lights in a variety of electronic devices. In their most basic form they look like this:

LED is short for light-emitting diode and as with any electric light it produces light when electrical current flows through it. The Wikipedia article on them says "Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons" which sounds way cool (although I will admit I have no idea what an electron hole is).

In this experiment we are going to

- build a device that connects a single LED to the Arduino UNO.
- get our laptops set up so we can write programs throughout the course
- write our first program and upload it to the Arduino.
- after our success with getting a light to blink, we will work on a number of remixes.

Parts Needed
You will need the following parts:

- 1x LED (Choose any color)
- 1x 330Ω Resistor (the Ω is the symbol for ohm)
- 2x Jumper Wires (any color)

## Hardware Hookup

### Resistors

As the parts list shows, you need a 330 ohm resistor. If you are lucky your resistors will initially be on a paper tape indicating the ohm value:

If you are very lucky your resistors will be loose and you will need to determine the value based on the colored bands. We will learn more about this later but if you look at the image above of the LED, the resistor and wires, you will notice there are colored bands around the resistor. The metalic color band should be on the right, and we read the colors from left to right. So in the above example, we have 5 bands and they are orange, orange, black, black, gold. As we will learn, that represents a 330Ω resistor. It is also common for resistors to have only 4 bands. In that scheme, a 330Ω resistor would be represented by orange, orange, brown, and some metalic color. Again, for you resistor geeks out there, we will get into more of the details later.

As you can see resistors come with beautifully straight wires, which are called legs. In order to fit the legs into the breadboard holes or sockets. We have the option to be sloppy and just sort of curve the wires around until they fit into the socket. The preferred, elegant, professional, way is to bend the legs into 90° angles in order to correctly fit the breadboard sockets.

If you look online you will see tools that will help you bend the resistor legs perfectly. We don't need that level of precision. Just do the best you can.

**Resistors don't have a right or wrong direction.**

### The LED

Pay close attention to the LED. They do have a right and wrong direction. The negative side of the LED is the short leg, marked with a flat edge.

#### This is important

Remember, the short leg of the LED is negative and the longer leg positive!

### Jumper wires

In a circuit we are connecting components together. For example, we might want to connect the resistor to the LED and those components to the Arduino UNO. When we want to experiment with circuits, rather than permanently connect components, we use a breadboard in combination with jumper wires. Jumper wires are just wires with pin connectors on each side that can easily be placed in a breadboard socket and are used to connect two points together. It makes no difference what color wire you use. The convention is that black is associated with negative, or ground and that probably would be a good rule to follow.

### The circuit diagram

Each experiment will have an associated diagram, which shows how to connect the components to the breadboard and the Arduino Uno. The diagram for this experiment is below.

Be sure to the polarity on the LED is correct. The short leg of the LED is connected to the resistor which in turn is connected to GND (ground) of the Arduino Uno.

## Installing the software

To program our devices we are going to use the Arduino IDE.

### Integrated Development Environment

An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is a software program that helps people write computer code and converts that code to a software application. For example, to write an iPhone or Android app, developers use specific IDEs. The Arduino IDE we will use allows us to

1. write computer code, much like a word processor
2. convert that code to a form understandable to the Arduino Uno
3. upload that converted code to the Uno.

Unfortuntely, the Arduino IDE is about 30 years behind the times. It looks like an application written in the 1990s and doesn't have the features you would expect a modern program to have. That said, it does reliably work and it is free!

The Arduino website offers excellent instructions on how to install the software on your laptop:

- [Windows](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows)
- [Mac OS X](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/MacOSX)
- [Linux](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Linux)

Using those instructions, go ahead and install the Arduino IDE. Note that the installation instructions ask you for a donation but you have the option to select 'just download'.

## Write the program to blink the LED light.

Open up the Arduino IDE (the program you just installed in the step above). Then, under the file menu select **New** and type in the following program

    /*
    Our First Blink an LED program
    */

    // setup runs exactly once
    void setup() {
       pinMode(2, OUTPUT);     // Initialize the pin 2 as an output pin
    }

    // the loop function runs over and over again forever
    void loop() {
        digitalWrite(2, HIGH);          // turn on the LED connected to pin 2
        delay(1000);                    // Wait for a second
        digitalWrite(2, LOW);           // turn off the LED
        delay(1000);                    // Wait for one second
    }

Go ahead and save your program

### Bullet 1 of 10: Work to Code

We have already introduced the 10 bullets of the course that all should follow. Part of bullet 1, work to code, is that all lines within `void setup` and `void loop` need to be indented. In the above example, it is easy to see what the instructions are for loop. The following do not meet the requirement of work to code:

![](/arduino/img/ide1b.png)

![](/arduino/img/ide1d.png)

![](/arduino/img/ide1c.png)

All have identical instructions and will work with the Arduino, but they are not as readable to humans. If you come back to your code a few weeks from now, you want to easily understand it.

### Bullet 5 of 10: Always be organized

Take the time to be organized and always be organized. By default, the Arduino IDE saves the file as "sketch_today's_date" in the general Arduino folder. If you are looking for the code you wrote 2 to 3 weeks ago that controlled the brightness of an LED light and your 50 Arduino code files are labeled:

- sketch_dec03b
- sketch_dec03c
- sketch_dec04a
- sketch_dec04b
- sketch_dec07a
- sketch_dec07b
- sketch_dec07c
- sketch_dec07d
- sketch_dec08a
- ...

You are going to have a hard time finding the correct file. If sometimes you save your file to the Arduino folder and sometimes to the desktop you are going to have a hard time finding the correct file.

**Always be organized** means have a directory for the class that is well-named. Have subdirectories for each set of projects, and give your files helpful names:

- oneLedBlinking
- twoLedsAlternating
- twoLedsWaltz

**Always be organized** also means having the directory automatically backed up to the cloud. There are a number of easy, free options including:

- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/individual?cid=2c9c534a3d010782975524e5a0d87cf8L)
- [Apple iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/)
- [Microsoft OneDrive Basic](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage)
- [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/drive/)

If your laptop dies, is stolen, catches on fire, or gets run over by a steam roller, having your work automatically backed up will be a relief.

### Back to coding ...

Next, under the Tools menu under the **Board** submenu select **Adafruit HUZZAH esp8266**.\*\*

Then, check your program by clicking on the checkmark icon

![](pics/check.png)

The check is optional. It just checks your program for syntax errors. Next you can upload your program to your board by clicking on the arrow icon:

![](pics/load.png)

You now should have a blinking LED light.
