# LED lights

## Introduction

We are all familiar with LED lights. They are all around us from household lights, flashlights, and indicator lights in a variety of electronic devices. In their most basic form they look like this:

LED is short for light-emitting diode and as with any electric light it produces light when electrical current flows through it. The Wikipedia article on them says "Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons" which sounds way cool (although I will admit I have no idea what an electron hole is).

In this experiment we are going to

- build a device that connects a single LED to the Arduino UNO.
- get our laptops set up so we can write programs throughout the course
- write our first program and upload it to the Arduino.
- after our success with getting a light to blink, we will work on a number of remixes.

Parts Needed
You will need the following parts:

- 1x LED (Choose any color)
- 1x 330Ω Resistor (the Ω is the symbol for ohm)
- 2x Jumper Wires (any color)

## Hardware Hookup

### Resistors

As the parts list shows, you need a 330 ohm resistor. If you are lucky your resistors will initially be on a paper tape indicating the ohm value:

If you are very lucky your resistors will be loose and you will need to determine the value based on the colored bands. We will learn more about this later but if you look at the image above of the LED, the resistor and wires, you will notice there are colored bands around the resistor. The metalic color band should be on the right, and we read the colors from left to right. So in the above example, we have 5 bands and they are orange, orange, black, black, gold. As we will learn, that represents a 330Ω resistor. It is also common for resistors to have only 4 bands. In that scheme, a 330Ω resistor would be represented by orange, orange, brown, and some metalic color. Again, for you resistor geeks out there, we will get into more of the details later.

As you can see resistors come with beautifully straight wires, which are called legs. In order to fit the legs into the breadboard holes or sockets. We have the option to be sloppy and just sort of curve the wires around until they fit into the socket. The preferred, elegant, professional, way is to bend the legs into 90° angles in order to correctly fit the breadboard sockets.

If you look online you will see tools that will help you bend the resistor legs perfectly. We don't need that level of precision. Just do the best you can.

**Resistors don't have a right or wrong direction.**

### The LED

Pay close attention to the LED. They do have a right and wrong direction. The negative side of the LED is the short leg, marked with a flat edge.

#### This is important

Remember, the short leg of the LED is negative and the longer leg positive!

### Jumper wires

In a circuit we are connecting components together. For example, we might want to connect the resistor to the LED and those components to the Arduino UNO. When we want to experiment with circuits, rather than permanently connect components, we use a breadboard in combination with jumper wires. Jumper wires are just wires with pin connectors on each side that can easily be placed in a breadboard socket.

### The circuit diagram

Each experiment will have an associated diagram, which shows how to connect the components to the breadboard and the Arduino Uno. The diagram for this experiment is below.

All jumper wires work the same. They are used to connect two points together. All the experiments will show the wires with different colored insulations for clarity, but using different combinations of colors is completely acceptable.

Be sure to the polarity on the LED is correct. The longer lead should be connected to pin 2. You will need to slightly bend the longer leg so that both are the same length when placed int he breadboard.

## Installing the software

There are three things you need to install

1. The Arduino IDE
2. The USB driver (SiLabs CP2104 driver)
3. The ESP8266 Board Package

### Step 1. Installing the Arduino IDE.

This step is the easiest of the three. The term **IDE** is a standard computer science one meaning _Integrated Development Environment_. \* It's sort of a specialized text editor that

1. enables you to type in code and save it to a file. Much like Microsoft Word or Mac Pages.
2. converts that code into a form that can be read by the Feather Huzzah board.
3. transfers the converted code to the Huzzah.

Download and install the Arduino IDE Software from [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

Now you need to install an Ardiuno IDE add-on that enables us to use our processor boards.

### Step 2 Installing the SilLabs Driver

The instructions are [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-huzzah-esp8266/pinouts?view=all#using-arduino-ide) under the headings **Don't forget you will also need to install the SiLabs CP2104 Driver**,

### Step 3 Installing the ESP8266 Board Package

Instructions for installing this package are in the section [**Install the ESP8266 Board Package**](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-huzzah-esp8266/pinouts?view=all#install-the-esp8266-board-package-6-10)

## Write the program to blink the LED light.

Open up the Arduino IDE (the program you just installed in the step above). Then, under the file menu select **New** and type in the following program

    /*
    Our First Blink an LED program
    */

    // setup runs exactly once
    void setup() {
       pinMode(2, OUTPUT);     // Initialize the pin 2 as an output pin
    }

    // the loop function runs over and over again forever
    void loop() {
        digitalWrite(2, HIGH);          // turn on the LED connected to pin 2
        delay(1000);                    // Wait for a second
        digitalWrite(2, LOW);           // turn off the LED
        delay(1000);                     // Wait for one second
    }

Next, under the Tools menu under the **Board** submenu select **Adafruit HUZZAH esp8266**.\*\*

Then, check your program by clicking on the checkmark icon

The check is optional. It just checks your program for syntax errors. Next you can upload your program to your board by clicking on the arrow icon:

You now should have a blinking LED light.
