## Experiment 9:

# Finally some Music

In this experiment we are going to learn how to make a speaker or buzzer click. Now a click may not sound like much :-) but when we put clicks together we can make more interesting sounds. For example, if we have 440 clicks in a second we have the note 'A'. If we have 3 short periods of it clicking at 392 clicks per second followed by a period of it clicking at 261 clicks per second we have the opening four notes of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony (albeit in a musical greeting card quality). Let's get clicking.

#### Parts Needed

You will need:

- 1x buzzer or speaker
- a Few Jumper Wires

## Hardware Hookup

## The basic code

```
int speaker = 3;

// We'll set up an array with the notes we want to play
// change these values to make different songs!

// Length must equal the total number of notes and spaces

   //
  //
 // SONG 1
//
void song1(){
   const int songLength = 17;
   String notes[] = {"C4", "D4", "F4", "D4", "A4", " ",  "A4", "G4", " ",
                     "C4", "D4", "F4", "D4", "G4", " ", "G4", "F4"};
   //a space represents a rest

   // Beats is an array of values for each note and rest.
   // A 1 represents the shortest note in the song. If it is an eighth note, then 1 = an eighth note,
   // if the shortest note is a 16th note, then 1 represents a 16th note
   // Don't forget that the rests (spaces) need a length as well.
   int beats[] = {1,1,1,1,1,1,4,4,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,4,2};

   // the notes and beats array are aligned meaning the first note C4 has a beat of 1.

   int tempo = 150;

   int i, duration;

   // step through the song array
   for (i = 0; i < songLength; i++){
      duration = beats[i] * tempo;   // length of note/rest in ms
      if (notes[i] == " ") {         // is this a rest?
        delay(duration);             // then pause for a moment
      }
      else {                         // otherwise, play the note
        tone(speaker, frequency(notes[i]), duration);
        delay(duration);             // wait for tone to finish
      }
      delay(tempo/10);              // brief pause between notes
   }
}

   //
  //
 // SETUP
//
void setup() {
  pinMode(speaker, OUTPUT);
}

   //
  //
 // LOOP
//
void loop() {
    song1();
    delay(2000);
}

   //
  //
 // FREQUENCY
//
int frequency(String note) {
  // This function takes a note string (for example C4), and returns the
  // corresponding frequency in Hz for the tone() function.

  int i;
  int numNotes = 8;  // number of notes we're storing

  String names[] = { "C4", "D4", "E4", "F4", "G4", "A4", "B4", "C5" };
  int frequencies[] = {262, 294, 330, 349, 392, 440, 494, 523};

  for (i = 0; i < numNotes; i++) {
    if (names[i] == note) {        // Is this the one?
      return(frequencies[i]);     // Yes! Return the frequency
    }
  }
  return(0);
}

```

When you upload the code you should hear a song that annoyingly repeats over, and over and over again.

### Comments

#### The Frequency Procedure

Note that the frequency procedure is similar to the `lookup` procedure in our array experiment. In the `lookup` procedure we gave the procedure a name, _Addie_ as an example, and it returned the person's age. In the `frequency` procedure, we give the procedure the name of a note, F4 as an example, and it returns that note's frequency, 349 in this case.

Let's say we want to write our own song and it requires a new note, say C#4. We look up its frequency on the [frequencies for the equal temperament scale](http://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html) and see that the frequency is 277.18. We round that to 277 and add the name of the note (C#4) to the names array and its frequency to the frequencies array ...

```
  String names[] = { "C4", "C#4", "D4", "E4", "F4", "G4", "A4", "B4", "C5" };
  int frequencies[] = {262, 277, 294, 330, 349, 392, 440, 494, 523};
```

### The song1 procedure

Within the song1 procedure a song is represented by the variables, `songLength`, `notes` and `beats`. `songLength` is simply the number of entries in the `notes` array. The `notes` array contains the names of the notes to play and the `beats` array represents how long to play each note. Let's say we want to play a new song. Perhaps this one ...

![](/arduino/img/dua.png)

We are only going to encode the top line of notes and for now let's just look at the first measure:

![](/arduino/img/dua2.png)

The notes of that measure are

C4, B3, A3, B3, C4, B3, A3.

So the notes array will be

```
String notes[] = {"C4", "B3", "A3", "B3", "C4", "B3", "A3"}'
```

The shortest notes of the songs are eighth notes so those will get 1 beat. The first 6 notes of the song are eighth notes and the 7th note is a quarter note so the beats array will be

```
int beats[] = {1,1,1,1,1,1, 2};
```

## Remix 1: The Song

Can you write code to have the buzzer play a recognizable (and correct) tune that spans an octave and a half?

Don't know music? This remix is a great opportunity to have a conversation with someone that does.
